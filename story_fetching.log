tetime(2018, 3, 29, 0, 0), 'ASG Technologies, a provider of proven solutions for information access, management and control for the world’s top enterprises, has launched Mobius 8.0, the latest version of the company’s intelligent information management solution that delivers content services with a granular policy management foundation to digitally transform enterprise content and data according to corporate polices and regulatory compliance.\n\nThis latest release of Mobius gives organizations the ability to apply policies to corporate information to manage the variety and velocity of enterprise content – regardless of format – with accuracy and reliability at web-scale volumes. Mobius deploys in public and private clouds, on-premises and hybrid computing environments, meeting a variety of information-driven business use cases and digital transformation projects.\n\nWith the explosion of today’s digital organization, businesses are generating more data than ever and require access to a set of web services for capturing, describing, delivering and governing content through a standard documented RESTful API.\n\nThis is a challenge given the complicated array of new and legacy platforms on which modern organizations run – especially given the rise of mobile workers and the complexities of industry regulation. As a result, users are too often faced with time-intensive information management processes that detract from their time spent innovating and delivering value to the business.\n\nTo meet those demands, Mobius 8.0 provides organizations with the ability to federate and/or migrate any content type from any redundant ECM application regardless of size, format, volume or platform. Lines of business can systematically rationalize enterprise content, reduce content sprawl, retire costly and outdated legacy content repositories, and better leverage modern content applications. The result is improved operational performance, increased system effectiveness, improved overall profitability and greater assurance that information is managed to be secure and compliant with regulations and internal governance standards.\n\nMobius 8 provides a unified approach to access content in redundant repositories from a common search facility. Full-text search across repositories (including Unicode and double-byte support and multiple languages) provides a single, logical access point to content across the enterprise delivered seamlessly to the end user or application. In addition, it delivers encryption at rest, redaction of personally identifiable and sensitive personal data based on defined policies, and event-based records management across the entire Mobius deployment and federated content repositories.\n\nAdministration assistance is provided through a single view to monitor, audit and track how business information is acquired, accessed, updated and used over the course of its life cycle. In addition, it provides the ability to ingest, parse and archive petabytes of data at web-scale loads, selectively index information for full-text search and deliver faster throughput for high-volume processing. Mylti-tier storage policies also automate the placement, movement and management of content across on-premises, hybrid and cloud environments including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.\n\n\n\nFor more information, visit www.asg.com.', 'http://www.kmworld.com/Articles/News/News/ASG-Technologies-Unveils-Mobius-8.0-124147.aspx')

The new capabilities include Aprimo Idea Lab—a new ideation solution that helps content marketing and creative teams ideate faster and better in the early stages of the content ideation and planning process. Aprimo Idea Lab connects into the Aprimo platform, which includes workflow management and digital asset management solutions that help content marketers integrate processes and move through the end-to-end content lifecycle.

Idea Lab enables content marketing teams to digitize the content ideation process. The solution provides teams a visual canvas to help marketers quickly create ideas and decide which ones should move into the market with workspaces to help collect and share early-stage ideas; ad hoc collaboration capabilities to allow teams to quickly and brainstorm new concepts together; planning and calendar capabilities to view when and where ideas can be brought to market; the ability to connect finalized ideas into actionable marketing plans; and a single cloud-based solution to manage the content lifecycle at scale.

In addition to Idea Lab, Aprimo also announced capabilities for content marketers including Article Editor in its Digital Asset Management product. Article Editor enables content marketers to support text-based content along with rich media content in one interface. Content marketing teams can create and edit publishable marketing copy content, store channel-agnostic copy, or configure channel-specific templates, and search and insert DAM assets—including images and videos.

Adobe also announced technology enhancements to Adobe Cloud Platform, as well as a new customer enablement program designed to help customers to become the architects of digital transformation at their companies.

The product updates were announced at Adobe Summit in Las Vegas.

Adobe’s next generation Adobe Cloud Platform—the Experience System of Record—includes a new unified customer profile, Adobe Sensei services, and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) readiness. Adobe Cloud Platform enhancements will make it easier to unify data from disparate systems into an Experience Cloud Profile, enable data scientists and developers to better customize Adobe Sensei capabilities to suit their organizations’ needs, and speed the deployment of custom code and workflows.

In addition, Adobe Advertising Cloud, an end-to-end platform for managing advertising across traditional TV and digital formats, will now help bridge the divide between today’s creative and media professionals. Adobe’s new Advertising Cloud Creative is a self-serve platform that expands Adobe’s Dynamic Creative Optimization (DCO) helping marketers take control over basic design elements—including advertising copy and assets used in display ads—to allow for the rapid rollout of new messaging and design without the painful and expensive steps of re-trafficking or starting the design process from scratch. Creative assets that are designed in Adobe Creative Cloud will be automatically available in Adobe Advertising Cloud Creative, so marketers can edit, target and optimize personalized display advertising across ad sizes.

Adobe Analytics Cloud is the leading system of intelligence for the modern enterprise, integrating rich analytics capabilities with data management and audience syndication. At Adobe Summit, Adobe unveiled Adobe Analytics for streaming audio, giving brands a way to gain deep insights into online and offline audio, including understanding listening behaviors, streaming quality and monetization opportunities. Adobe also unveiled general availability of Adobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op, a core service of the Experience Cloud. Leveraging the power of Adobe Analytics Cloud and Adobe Sensei, the Device Co-op aggregates anonymous device data from participating Adobe customers, enabling individual brands to recognize actual consumers, not just devices, across digital touchpoints. All this is done while ensuring the highest level of privacy and transparency. More than 60 global brands have joined the Device Co-op so far, enabling them to reach over 300 million consumers across 1.8 billion devices in the U.S. and Canada.

With the latest release of Adobe Experience Manager, the company also unveiled new Adobe Sensei-powered content capabilities in Experience Manager including intelligent image discovery, allowing the tailoring of images for different screens and automated personalization of content. Additionally, native support of Experience Manager from within Creative Cloud applications unify creative and marketer workflows for the first time. Innovations in Adobe Campaign include a new creative designer to simplify email creation as well as email templates pre-built with Adobe’s Behance that marketers can leverage. Adobe also announced marketers and data scientists can now customize their algorithms in Adobe Target, unlocking the power of artificial intelligence for personalization.

With these additions, Clarabridge aims to better equip companies with actionable insights from customer interactions in order to reduce customer churn, increase ROI and drive sales.

According to Clarabridge, it is becoming more critical for companies to capture and make sense of all customer feedback, as the channels through which customers interact with brands continue to increase. Clarabridge allows companies to harvest, bring together and analyze all of this data, as well as engage with their customers where they are.

Within CX Social, the Clarabridge Inbox Mobile App now includes popular desktop features such as Crisis Plans, Conversation View and Approval Workflows, to help brands to respond to customers and engage with them on the go. This application uses the Clarabridge AI platform to aggregate all brand mentions in one place, automatically sorting, categorizing, routing and prioritizing feedback for agents to respond, without requiring them to be at a desk. Clarabridge now allows brands to leverage the power of CX Social through cloud-based instant messaging service, Telegram, to ensure that brands using CX Social are able to meet and engage customers where they are and in their channel of choice. In addition, companies with a public knowledge base can now connect it to CX Social utilizing Bing’s Customer Search to expedite the search process for agents looking to provide customers with helpful resources. Additionally, for companies with multiple social profiles, the Clarabridge platform now allows brands to save these to dedicated groups.

Clarabridge’s updates to its CX Analytics offerings also arm companies with the latest AI powered technology to uncover insights that enhance customer experience and drive brand loyalty. These include Clarabridge’s NLP technology and machine learning techniques which allow companies to identify which customers are likely to churn based on the linguistic features of their feedback. With this new Clarabridge release, companies will be able to use the ‘churn’ sentence type within Case Management to flag at-risk customers and pair them with an agent equipped to intervene. Clarabridge has also added Tagalog to its extensive list of NLP language packs; and with Clarabridge’s new filtered metrics, companies can perform complex calculations over custom subsets of data to better connect data points and identify key trends (regardless of how disparate those datasets may seem).

“It really is disruptive, it is net new, and it is really where we see the market evolving and it’s all based on insight from our customers,” said Miles Kelly, chief marketing officer at OneLogin. “It is a breakthrough, it allows organizations to want to fully transform.”

The new platform is a modern Web Access Management solution, enabling customers to manage access for traditional on-premise applications such as Oracle and SAP by using a “single pane” management console that also manages access for cloud applications, with two unique benefits.

First, it features a modern architecture using elastic cloud-managed gateways and agents, with a Docker-based deployment model.

Second, OneLogin Access features modern identity integrations using standard protocols like SAML, such that legacy applications can easily be secured with a variety of authentication factors, strengthened with adaptive authentication, and monitored with out-of-the-box security information and event management (SIEM).

These benefits make OneLogin Access particularly appealing to DevOps Managers, IT Managers, architects, and identity managers looking to replace their aging web access management solutions, according to Kelly.

With OneLogin Access, companies now can modify access privileges across all applications in real time vs. days or weeks, and slash access management costs.

This platform unifies access management not only for applications, but also for networks and devices, using SaaS infrastructure to synchronize all corporate users and user directories.

OneLogin features one integrated interface, one audit trail, and one support experience to optimize the customer experience.

The company’s solution integrates with Active Directory in real time versus batch-uploading and leverages adaptive authentication technologies to benchmark typical user behavior and detect anomalies, mitigate risk, and improve security without sacrificing usability.

Moving forward, the company will focus on continuing its customer first approach to enhance the platform along with delivering the product and all of its value.

“Being a successful, innovative company based in San Francisco in the midst of Silicon Valley, we’re hard at work at innovation in general,” Kelly said. “This world of access management and security is just a fascinatingly sophisticated, complicated but really beautiful part of the technology world and so our engineering teams, developers, and sales people are all hard at work at solving the next big set of problems.”

The platform includes a Data Catalog, a new feature that allows data owners and data stewards to utilize a machine learning-based smart catalog to create, maintain and search business rules; define policies and provide governance workflow functionality. Io-Tahoe''s data discovery capability provides business rule management and enrichment, and enables a business user to govern the rules and define policies for critical data elements. It allows data-driven enterprises to enhance information about data automatically, regardless of the underlying technology and build a data catalog.

Io-Tahoe allows an organization to conduct data discovery across heterogeneous enterprise landscapes, ranging from databases, data warehouses and data lakes, bringing disparate data worlds together into a common view which can lead to a universal metadata store, said Oksana Sokolovsky, CEO, Io-Tahoe. This in turn enables organizations to have insight into their data to help them achieve their business goals, drive data analytics, enhance data governance and meet regulatory demands required in advance of regulations such as GDPR.

Citing data from MarketsandMarkets, Io-Tahoe says the data discovery market is estimated to grow from $4.33 billion in 2016 to $10.66 billion in 2021. This is driven by the increasing importance of data-driven decision making and self-service business intelligence tools, the company says, noting, however, that the challenge of integrating the growing number of disparate platforms, databases, data lakes and other silos of data has prevented the comprehensive governance, and use, of enterprise data.

Io-Tahoe''s smart data discovery platform features an algorithmic approach to auto-discover rich information about data and data relationships. Its machine learning technology looks beyond metadata, at the data itself for greater insight and visibility into complex data sets, across the enterprise. Built to scale for even the largest of enterprises, Io-Tahoe makes data available to everyone in the organization, untangling the complex maze of data relationships and enabling applications such as data science, data analytics, data governance and data management.

Data Summit will take place this year at the Hyatt Regency Boston, May 22-23, with pre-conference workshops on Monday, May 21. Cognitive Computing Summit will also be co-located at the event.

Cognitive computing and AI have garnered a great deal of attention particularly in the last year and a half, says Reynolds. There is a lot of interest among executives spanning a range of industries in the potential for change they pose in terms of the ability to get meaningful answers to vexing questions faster and improve the business, as well as the possible disruption of their existing business models.

But, he notes, according to research by the Cognitive Computing Consortium it is also clear that there is some confusion about the terminology and the technology it represents. AI is seen as having broad implications for everything from self-driving cars to improved diagnostics in medical research, says Reynolds, who notes it is almost as if it’s a Swiss army knife and where one person sees a corkscrew, another sees a can opener.

To be effective, the application of AI and cognitive computing must be rooted in an organization identifying its goals and the business value that will come out of the implementation, says Reynolds. In addition, there are also a host of “really practical challenges” that must be overcome since AI requires a multitude of different data types and technologies such as unstructured data such as video, text, Twitter feeds, and structured data in databases. Overall, AI puts a much greater weight on unstructured data and requires the ability to merge data across silos, with governance and security added in.

All of this involves a higher level of data integration and data understanding than most companies are able to deliver now, notes Reynolds, who will present an open reference framework jointly developed with Babson College’s technology management program. The framework gives executives and operating managers a tool to evaluate the impact and behaviors of potential AI applications.

Reynolds will present his keynote on Wednesday May 23, at 8:45 am.

By locating, identifying, and classifying personal data across an organization’s applications and data sources, the updated solution will help support companies in preparing and meeting compliance guidelines by the May 25, 2018 GDPR deadline, and will also help to ensure companies maintain and stay in compliance as GDPR and other regulations evolve.

Gartner predicts that more than 50% of companies affected by GDPR will not be in full compliance by the May deadline. A key element of the compliance challenges is the fact that enterprises have a limited understanding of where personal data resides within the organization—including poor data insight and management

It is important to note that GDPR is not a point in time. It is a change in how organizations need to manage data, said Rob Perry, ASG’s VP of product marketing. That is why they need to think about making changes now and into the future. It is a constant process of understanding their data and also understanding how new uses of data will affect compliance, he noted. In addition there are many new issues that GDPR presents such as the need to minimize data and delete it if it is not necessary and to alert EU residents in a short timeframe if there is a breach. GDPR is likely to evolve over time, he added, so it will be necessary for organizations to rely on solutions that can change as well.

To help organizations more easily discover, manage and govern personal data, the enhanced enterprise data intelligence solution supports a five-step approach to compliance including creating a personal data inventory with applications and data sources scanned to discover and trace the use of personal data throughout the enterprise; and the use of automation to discover applications, identify personal data and assign criticality, and identification of application owners.

The solution provides data lineage analysis that tracks personal data seed items backward and forward, tracing every instance of the items across applications, data stores, and business processes, as well as by policy requirements; and helps create a privacy risk assessment structure in which key metrics are identified, personal data tagged, uses of personal data are assessed, and reports and dashboards to manage and record assessments are created.

“Our platform is very flexible and extensible. GDPR is an ideal application for the platform we have,” said Perry noting, it offers comprehensive approach that is flexible enough to address any changes that may occur.

With graph technology becoming increasingly popular in today’s data-driven organizations, the partnership opens a new option to SQL users who will be able use their existing query skills and familiar data access tools to access the integration of diverse data sources.

According to the companies, the new partnership addresses three facts of enterprise data management: Data has become a strategic asset for enterprises, enterprise knowledge graphs are growing in use, and the world still relies on SQL. This partnership with CData Software helps solve a large industry problem by ensuring that SQL users don’t get left behind when it comes to accessing graphs, said Steve Dischinger, vice president business development, Cambridge Semantics. As customers look to analyze data that is increasingly inter-connected and linked, they will be able to leverage their existing database query skills, he noted.

“Our universally supported driver technologies provide a ubiquitous bridge between data and a greater ecosystem of analytics and integration tools,” said Amit Sharma, CEO of CData Software. "We are excited to work with Cambridge Semantics to bring these technologies to the Anzo Smart Data Lake platform, simplifying the process for end users to work with their data in a graph-based environment."

CData Software specializes in the development of drivers and data access technologies for real-time access to online or on-premise applications, databases, and SaaS APIs.

Vivendi, which is Telecom Italia’s (TIM) biggest shareholder, built up a 28.8 percent shareholding in Mediaset last year, making it the second biggest shareholder after the family of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.

But in April Italy’s communications industry regulator (AGCOM) told Vivendi to reduce its stake in one of the two Italian companies, saying it was anti-competitive.

Vivendi, which is appealing against the ruling, has told AGCOM it will take a series of measures to meet the watchdog’s concern, including transferring a stake of at least 19.19 percent of Mediaset shares to a blind trust.

“Clearly we do not know anything more than you know, we read the press release by AGCOM,” Mediaset Chief Financial Officer Marco Giordani said in a post-results call with analysts.

He added that the regulator was “clearly stating what Vivendi should do”, adding there was nothing more to say. He did not explain if the proposed trust solution would be a final or a temporary one.

Giordani also said Mediaset had not been approached by Vivendi over a possible plan to create a broad-based joint-venture involving Mediaset, Telecom Italia and the French’s pay-TV unit Canal Plus.

“We never met them, did not receive any offer and we do not know the business plan, nothing,” Giordani said.

He also said a continuing legal dispute with Vivendi would have to be resolved, “before considering any partnership”.

Mediaset and Vivendi are engaged in a bitter court battle after the French company pulled out of an 800 million-euro deal last July that would have given it full control of the Milan-based group’s pay-TV unit.

The failure of that deal cost the group 341.3 million euros and an overall loss in last year’s results.

In the first half of this year revenues for the pay-TV unit, Premium, fell to 299.7 million euros from 308.5 million euros in the same period last year.

But the group said that after more than doubling its operating profit in the first half of the year, a pick-up in advertising would result in a full-year profit, both at the operating and after-tax levels.

In a complaint filed with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Nielsen is seeking an injunction to stop the launch of comScore’s Extended TV service, which it said would incorporate its proprietary Portable People Meter data.

ComScore declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying the matter was being addressed through binding arbitration.

The dispute arose from Nielsen’s 2013 purchase of Arbitron Inc, which was completed after those companies promised federal regulators to preserve competition for “cross-platform” services measuring both television and online viewership.

Nielsen, based in New York, said it contracted in 2014 to let its Reston, Virginia-based rival use Portable People Meter data to measure both TV and online audiences.

But it said that contract forbade using the data for “individual, stand-alone services,” which it said include Extended TV.

Nielsen said it has several large contracts up for renewal, and would suffer “irreparable harm to its business through [the] loss of important customers and decreased market share” if comScore launched Extended TV, perhaps by the end of 2017.

According to the complaint, Nielsen has filed for arbitration as required by the contract to establish comScore’s alleged breach, but is entitled to seek a court-ordered injunction before the arbitration is resolved.

In an Aug. 8 letter attached to the complaint, a lawyer for comScore said Extended TV qualifies as a “cross-platform” service, and is “not limited to linear TV estimates as it measures content across multiple platforms, including but not limited to television, online, mobile, tablets, etc.”

The company also said it would turn over to congressional investigators the 3,000 political ads that it says were likely purchased by Russian entities during and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the company, for the first time, would now make it possible for anyone to see any political ads that run on Facebook, no matter whom they target.

Facebook will also demand that political advertisers disclose who is paying for the advertisements, a requirement that under U.S. law applies to political ads on television but not on social media.

“We will work with others to create a new standard for transparency in online political ads,” Zuckerberg said.

Zuckerberg, broadcasting live on Facebook from company headquarters in Menlo Park, California, said the changes would help address concerns that governments including Russia are using Facebook ads to meddle in other countries’ elections.

Earlier this month, Facebook said an internal review had shown that an operation likely based in Russia spent $100,000 on 3,000 Facebook ads promoting divisive messages in the months before and after last year’s U.S. presidential election. The company initially declined to turn over details on the ads to Congress.

U.S. congressional investigators and special counsel Robert Mueller are examining alleged Russian election interference, which Moscow has denied.

Investigators are interested in other companies as well. Representatives for Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) are set to meet next week with staff from the Senate Intelligence Committee in relation to inquiries into the 2016 election.

Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said on Thursday that he wants to hear from Facebook, Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, Twitter and others in public hearings.

“It will be important for the committee to scrutinize how rigorous Facebook’s internal investigation has been, to test its conclusions and to understand why it took as long as it did,” Schiff said in a statement.

‘WILD, WILD WEST’

The political advertising changes represent a retreat for Facebook, which for years has resisted calls from transparency advocates and academics for the regulation of political ads. The company has instead treated them like all commercial ads.

In the days after the November 2016 U.S. election, Zuckerberg said it was a “crazy idea” to think that misinformation on Facebook swayed the vote toward President Donald Trump.

Senator Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, this month compared political ads on social media to the “wild, wild West” and said legislation might be needed to address them.

The U.S. Federal Election Commission last week sought public comment on possible regulatory changes to digital ads and considered whether to call Facebook and other tech firms before the commission for a public hearing.

Facebook has grown to be the leading online platform for political ads because of its low costs and tools for targeting messages to narrow audiences.

U.S. political campaigns likely spent $300 million on Facebook ads during the 2016 election cycle, according to Nomura analysts, though the exact amount is unknown.

It remained unclear whether Facebook’s voluntary changes would satisfy demands for government action.

Warner and another senator, Democrat Amy Klobuchar, on Thursday sent a letter to colleagues inviting them to be co-sponsors of legislation they are writing that would formalize and expand the commitments Zuckerberg made.

The legislation, they wrote, would require digital platforms with 1 million or more users to maintain a publicly available file of all election-related ads bought by people who spend more than $10,000, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters.

Trevor Potter, president of the pro-transparency Campaign Legal Center, said in a statement that his group would “carefully monitor Facebook’s implementation of this new policy.” He said Facebook “helped create the secrecy that gave rise to foreign interference in the 2016 elections.”

In the past, Facebook has argued that ad details had to remain confidential unless released by the advertisers.

GERMAN ELECTION MONITORING

Zuckerberg, who returned to work on Thursday after a month of paternity leave, laid out other steps the company would take to prevent governments from using Facebook to manipulate each other’s elections.

He said Facebook would hire 250 additional people; expand partnerships with election commissions around the world; and adapt systems to help deter political bullying.

Facebook has not found an attempt at election-meddling in Germany, Zuckerberg said, but he added that the company would continue to examine fake accounts that it has removed in advance of Sunday’s German national election.

“I don’t want anyone to use our tools to undermine democracy. That’s not what we stand for,” Zuckerberg said.

Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch said in a blog post on Thursday that it was unusual for Facebook to voluntarily turn over information to government authorities, as it was doing by giving U.S. lawmakers copies of ads.

U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia engaged in cyber attacks to sway the 2016 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton in favor of Trump. U.S. congressional investigators and a special counsel are investigating the matter. Moscow has denied any interference.

While Trump dismissed the advertisement controversy, his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, expressed concern.

The talks indicate Australia’s traditional media owners are wasting little time capitalizing on the liberalization of ownership laws to explore deals designed to expand their audience reach and compete harder against new foreign rivals.

Shares in Prime, the likely takeover target in any talks with Seven, fell sharply after the companies confirmed discussions had failed to bear fruit.

“There was a conceptual proposal received from Prime but ... this did not result in any agreement,” Seven said in a statement, without giving details.

Until this month, top-rating free-to-air Seven, about one-third owned by billionaire Kerry Stokes, was banned from buying its A$161 million ($128 million) regional partner Prime because of laws preventing one company from broadcasting to more than 75 percent of a market.

But Stokes and other traditional media players won long-sought reforms to the laws last week, allowing them to boost market share through consolidation.

“The law just changed last week and it will start a dialogue, but I don’t think anything definitive will happen in the short-term,” said Ashok Desai, associate director at stockbroker CPS Capital Group Pty Ltd.

Prime shares were down 7.4 percent and Seven shares were flat by mid-session on Friday, in a slightly higher overall market.

The Google logo is shown reflected on an adjacent office building in Irvine, California, U.S. August 7, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake

The EU is frustrated at how long it is taking the world’s rich nations to reach a deal on how to tax online firms like Google (GOOGL.O) fairly. These companies on average pay bills in Europe that are less than half of those of other firms.

To prevent some smaller EU economies such as Ireland or Luxembourg, which host many foreign online businesses, from blocking the move, the commission is also raising the prospect of using little-known EU rules that would prevent states from vetoing decisions on tax matters. Usually the EU decides on tax issues only with the unanimous support of its 28 members.

The commission on Thursday outlined three options for taxes aimed at internet companies that could be agreed upon relatively quickly at the EU level or by a smaller group of EU nations.

One was for a tax on the turnover rather than the profits of digital firms, another would put a levy on online ads, and a third would impose a withholding tax on payments to internet firms.

In the longer term the EU wants to change existing taxation rights to make sure digital firms with large operations but no physical presence in a given country pay taxes there instead of being allowed to reroute their profits to low-tax jurisdictions.

The EU’s preferred option would be for an agreement on this at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which includes the United States and Japan.

But “the EU must prepare to act in the absence of adequate global progress,” Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference in Brussels, saying that a legislative proposal may come next spring.

Such a move is likely to upset Washington and other rich nations that are home to many global tech giants.

In a document setting out the distortions created by the low taxes paid by digital businesses, the commission cited several U.S. firms such as internet retailer Amazon (AMZN.O), social media host Facebook (FB.O), online entertainment firm Netflix (NFLX.O) and short-term rental website Airbnb.

In the report, the commission emphasized that unilateral initiatives taken in the EU would need to be carefully assessed to ensure they are compatible with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.

“We would urge caution against EU-only measures that could run the risk of creating double taxation,” Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), a group representing accountants worldwide, said.

REMOVING VETOES

The EU will first have to reach a compromise agreement among its 28 members by December. Some states have already voiced their opposition to new taxes on digital firms, especially if decided on without a global deal in place.

To overcome this, the commission said there was a debate on whether to strip EU countries of their veto rights on tax issues, based on an article in the EU treaties that allows such exceptional action in the event of market distortions.

“There is a broader discussion whether we should move to decision-making based on majority also in the area of taxation,” Dombrovskis told reporters.

But he added: “Currently we are basing our proposal on current rules which foresee unanimity.”

Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker last week evoked another special procedure to move to majority-based rather than unanimous decisions in matters of taxation.', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-tax-digital/eu-eyes-solo-move-to-increase-tax-on-online-giants-risking-u-s-anger-idUSKCN1BW1P7') RETURNING "login_stories"."id"; args=('EU eyes solo move to increase tax on online giants, risking U.S. anger', 51, datetime.datetime(2017, 9, 21, 16, 44, 51, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Thursday it may seek to implement tax reform to raise more revenue from online giants without the backing of the United States and other rich nations, in a move that could spark a new transatlantic dispute.\n\nThe Google logo is shown reflected on an adjacent office building in Irvine, California, U.S. August 7, 2017.

Usually the EU decides on tax issues only with the unanimous support of its 28 members.\n\nThe commission on Thursday outlined three options for taxes aimed at internet companies that could be agreed upon relatively quickly at the EU level or by a smaller group of EU nations.\n\nOne was for a tax on the turnover rather than the profits of digital firms, another would put a levy on online ads, and a third would impose a withholding tax on payments to internet firms.\n\nIn the longer term the EU wants to change existing taxation rights to make sure digital firms with large operations but no physical presence in a given country pay taxes there instead of being allowed to reroute their profits to low-tax jurisdictions.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe EU’s preferred option would be for an agreement on this at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which includes the United States and Japan.\n\nBut “the EU must prepare to act in the absence of adequate global progress,” Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference in Brussels, saying that a legislative proposal may come next spring.\n\nSuch a move is likely to upset Washington and other rich nations that are home to many global tech giants.\n\nIn a document setting out the distortions created by the low taxes paid by digital businesses, the commission cited several U.S. firms such as internet retailer Amazon (AMZN.O), social media host Facebook (FB.O), online entertainment firm Netflix (NFLX.O) and short-term rental website Airbnb.\n\nIn the report, the commission emphasized that unilateral initiatives taken in the EU would need to be carefully assessed to ensure they are compatible with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.\n\n“We would urge caution against EU-only measures that could run the risk of creating double taxation,” Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), a group representing accountants worldwide, said.\n\nREMOVING VETOES\n\nThe EU will first have to reach a compromise agreement among its 28 members by December. Some states have already voiced their opposition to new taxes on digital firms, especially if decided on without a global deal in place.\n\nTo overcome this, the commission said there was a debate on whether to strip EU countries of their veto rights on tax issues, based on an article in the EU treaties that allows such exceptional action in the event of market distortions.\n\n“There is a broader discussion whether we should move to decision-making based on majority also in the area of taxation,” Dombrovskis told reporters.\n\nBut he added: “Currently we are basing our proposal on current rules which foresee unanimity.”\n\nCommission President Jean-Claude Juncker last week evoked another special procedure to move to majority-based rather than unanimous decisions in matters of taxation.', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-tax-digital/eu-eyes-solo-move-to-increase-tax-on-online-giants-risking-u-s-anger-idUSKCN1BW1P7')

Pressure is mounting on regulators and Silicon Valley companies to open up the opaque world of online political ads and to prevent governments from using them to sway elections or attempt other meddling.

“Social media platforms offer the ability to target millions of users based upon a wealth of highly detailed information,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter to the election commission.

“As we have seen, the low cost of reaching these users equips hostile foreign actors with a powerful new tool for disruption of our democratic process.”

Some 20 Democrats from the Senate and House of Representatives signed the letter.

Facebook temporarily disabled some targeting capabilities last week in response to the ProPublica investigation.

The document is part of an EU push to tap more revenues from online multinationals such as Amazon and Facebook, who are accused of paying too little tax in Europe by routing most of their profits to low-rate countries such as Ireland or Luxembourg.

The draft report, to be adopted on Thursday, said that on average brick-and-mortar multinationals pay in taxes in the EU more than twice what their digital competitors do.

Traditional large firms face a median 23.2 percent tax rate, while digital giants do not pay more than 10.1 percent - and when they sell directly to customers, rather than to firms, their effective rate goes down to 8.9 percent, data cited by the Commission showed.

An earlier report by a European lawmaker said EU states may have lost in tax revenues up to 5.4 billion euros ($6.5 billion) just from Facebook and Google, now part of Alphabet, between 2013 and 2015.

“A level playing field is a pre-condition for all businesses to be able to innovate, develop and grow,” the Commission said, adding that fairer taxation of the digital economy was urgently needed.

Partly because of the uneven taxation, revenues in the EU retail sector grew on average by only 1 percent a year between 2008 and 2016, while in the same period revenues of the top-five online retailers, such as Amazon, grew on average by 32 percent per year, the Commission’s report says.

NEXT STEPS

The document, seen by Reuters, will be presented at a summit of EU leaders on September 29 dedicated to digital issues. Despite divergences and scepticism among some smaller states, the 28 EU countries are expected to find common ground on digital taxation by December.

The Commission is seeking a compromise among rich countries worldwide in a bid to reduce opposition from EU states that fear losing competitiveness if the EU moves ahead on its own in this field.

But “in the absence of adequate global progress, EU solutions should be advanced within the single market”, the document said, adding that a legislative proposal may be presented in the spring regardless of global developments.

The best way to tackle distortions would be to review the notion of “permanent establishment” so that firms could be taxed also in countries where they do not have a physical presence, the Commission said.

At the moment online companies can often avoid paying taxes in countries where they generate large revenues because they do not have a physical presence there.

A proposal to change the corporate tax base is already under discussion in the EU. The Commission believes it represents “a basis to address these key challenges”, but needs the unanimous support of EU states to turn the plan into law.

To move ahead more quickly, the Commission said short-term solutions could be considered. They include an “equalization” tax on turnover, as proposed by France and backed by 10 EU countries, the report said.

Alternative short-term options would be a withholding tax on payments to digital businesses and a levy on revenues from advertisements or other services provided by digital firms.

But short-term options “have pros and cons, and further work is needed”, the Commission said, warning that they may go against double-taxation treaties, state aid rules, fundamental freedoms and EU international commitments under free trade agreements and the World Trade Organization (WTO).', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-tax-digital/eu-ready-to-move-alone-on-digital-tax-if-no-global-deal-idUSKCN1BV1PF') RETURNING "login_stories"."id"; args=('EU ready to move alone on digital tax if no global deal', 51, datetime.datetime(2017, 9, 20, 14, 55, 49, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission said the EU should proceed with an overhaul of taxes on digital firms even if the rest of the rich world did not follow suit, a draft report said.\n\nThe document is part of an EU push to tap more revenues from online multinationals such as Amazon and Facebook, who are accused of paying too little tax in Europe by routing most of their profits to low-rate countries such as Ireland or Luxembourg.\n\nThe draft report, to be adopted on Thursday, said that on average brick-and-mortar multinationals pay in taxes in the EU more than twice what their digital competitors do.\n\nTraditional large firms face a median 23.2 percent tax rate, while digital giants do not pay more than 10.1 percent - and when they sell directly to customers, rather than to firms, their effective rate goes down to 8.9 percent, data cited by the Commission showed.\n\nAn earlier report by a European lawmaker said EU states may have lost in tax revenues up to 5.4 billion euros ($6.5 billion) just from Facebook and Google, now part of Alphabet, between 2013 and 2015.\n\n“A level playing field is a pre-condition for all businesses to be able to innovate, develop and grow,” the Commission said, adding that fairer taxation of the digital economy was urgently needed.\n\nPartly because of the uneven taxation, revenues in the EU retail sector grew on average by only 1 percent a year between 2008 and 2016, while in the same period revenues of the top-five online retailers, such as Amazon, grew on average by 32 percent per year, the Commission’s report says.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe document, seen by Reuters, will be presented at a summit of EU leaders on September 29 dedicated to digital issues.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that San Francisco’s ordinance unfairly targeted one group of products. The plaintiffs, including the American Beverage Association and the California Retailers Association, were likely to succeed with their claim that the ordinance was unjustified and violated commercial speech under the First Amendment, the court ruled.

The San Francisco ordinance is part of a growing national movement seeking to curb consumption of soft drinks and other high-calorie beverages that medical experts say are largely to blame for an epidemic of childhood obesity. Many localities also have moved to tax sugary beverages.

John Cote, a spokesman for San Francisco’s city attorney office, said the city is disappointed and evaluating all options.

“San Francisco remains committed to being a leader when it comes to protecting the health of our residents, especially our children,” Cote said.

San Francisco passed an ordinance in June 2015 requiring advertisers within the city to include a warning statement that said drinking high-sugar beverages contributed to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay.

A growing body of research has identified sugary drinks as the biggest contributors to added, empty calories in the American diet, and as a major culprit in a range of costly health problems associated with being overweight.

A federal judge had rejected the industry’s request for a pretrial injunction but had put the ordinance on hold pending the result of the appeal. A three-judge 9th Circuit panel on Tuesday unanimously decided that the lower court was wrong to deny the injunction.

San Francisco’s warning requirement is misleading and deceptive by focusing on a single product, the 9th Circuit ruled.

“The warning is required exclusively on advertisements for sugar-sweetened beverages, and not on advertisements for other products with equal or greater amounts of added sugars and calories,” the court wrote.

App Annie said it was now able to offer real-time statistics on mobile application usage in China by tracking hundreds of thousands of Android users there, both through its own apps and with additional data supplied by external partners. Statistical methods are used to identify general trends, it said.

“It’s crucial to provide an accurate picture to app publishers and brand (marketers) of what’s happening in China but also what’s happening globally in terms of app usage,” said Bertrand Schmitt, chief executive and co-founder of App Annie.

App Annie, which tracks mobile software downloads, counts 94 of the world’s top 100 app publishers as customers. They use the service to monitor the performance of their own apps against rivals. Major advertising brands such as McDonald’s, Nike, Citibank and AstraZeneca also use App Annie to target customers with their own apps.

The company said its new China Android monitoring service can track usage metrics on 5,000 top apps such as active users, which apps are used together and data usage, both for app makers looking to track their performance versus rivals there or brand marketers looking to target advertising spending within apps.

China accounted for 60 percent of the world’s $1.3 trillion total app spending including ecommerce, paid app store downloads and in-app advertising in 2016, according to App Annie.

Four of the world’s most played mobile games come from China, while Tencent’s WeChat ranks No. 3 globally among messaging apps behind Facebook’s WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.

App Annie was founded in Beijing in 2010 to measure the growth of the nascent smartphone apps market. It has tracked app usage on Apple iOS since its early days in China and expanded to cover Apple and Android users globally since then.

But the explosion of smartphones in China since 2012 thanks to Android phones, which now outnumber Apple users by 6 to 1 in a market with more than 700 million phone users, has been guesswork because of a lack of independent data on the market.

“When you look at mobile usage behavior and attitudes, China is really leading. The Chinese market is definitely ahead of the curve,” said Forrester mobile analyst Thomas Husson. “It was more or less a black box, so you need some clarity as to what’s going on, in aggregate, in the world’s biggest market.”

Dozens of mobile app analytics firms compete worldwide, including big software names such as Adobe, Facebook, Google and IBM and more focused players such as Apmetrix, Localytics, SimilarWeb and Taplytics. But only App Annie so far offers an integrated global view, including China.

App Annie is now headquartered in San Francisco and has $150 million in funding from venture investors including Sequoia Capital and IDG Capital Partners. Two-fifths of its 500 employees and most of its engineering staff are based in China.

REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo\n\nApp Annie said it was now able to offer real-time statistics on mobile application usage in China by tracking hundreds of thousands of Android users there, both through its own apps and with additional data supplied by external partners. Statistical methods are used to identify general trends, it said.\n\n“It’s crucial to provide an accurate picture to app publishers and brand (marketers) of what’s happening in China but also what’s happening globally in terms of app usage,” said Bertrand Schmitt, chief executive and co-founder of App Annie.\n\nApp Annie, which tracks mobile software downloads, counts 94 of the world’s top 100 app publishers as customers. They use the service to monitor the performance of their own apps against rivals. Major advertising brands such as McDonald’s, Nike, Citibank and AstraZeneca also use App Annie to target customers with their own apps.\n\nThe company said its new China Android monitoring service can track usage metrics on 5,000 top apps such as active users, which apps are used together and data usage, both for app makers looking to track their performance versus rivals there or brand marketers looking to target advertising spending within apps.\n\nChina accounted for 60 percent of the world’s $1.3 trillion total app spending including ecommerce, paid app store downloads and in-app advertising in 2016, according to App Annie.\n\nFour of the world’s most played mobile games come from China, while Tencent’s WeChat ranks No. 3 globally among messaging apps behind Facebook’s WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.\n\nApp Annie was founded in Beijing in 2010 to measure the growth of the nascent smartphone apps market.

ProPublica, a non-profit news organization based in New York, reported hours earlier that Facebook’s self-service ad-buying platform had allowed marketers to target ads at people who, on their Facebook profile, had listed phrases such as “Jew hater” as their field of study or work.

Some 2,300 people had expressed interest in the topics “Jew hater,” “how to burn Jews” and “History of ‘why Jews ruin the world’,” according to ProPublica’s investigation.

Facebook, the world’s largest social network, confirmed the ProPublica investigation.

Once people put those phrases on their Facebook profiles, the anti-Semitic topics automatically migrated onto the company’s advertising platform, as if they were education or job data that would be useful to marketers, Facebook said.

“We are removing these self-reported targeting fields until we have the right processes in place to help prevent this issue,” Facebook said in a statement late on Thursday.

“We want Facebook to be a safe place for people and businesses, and we’ll continue to do everything we can to keep hate off Facebook,” it said.

Facebook initially responded to the ProPublica report by removing the topics in question from its ad system. However other news reports, including from Slate magazine, then discovered that hateful topics were more widespread in the ad system’s targeting capabilities.

As Facebook has given advertisers greater power to micro-target their messages using a self-service platform, the company has at times failed to ensure they comply with its terms and conditions.

Last year, ProPublica reported that Facebook allowed advertisers to exclude users by race when running housing or other ads, despite a prohibition on such ads under the U.S. Fair Housing Act 1969.

Facebook said last week an operation likely based in Russia spent $100,000 on thousands of U.S. ads promoting social and political messages over a two-year period through May, fueling concerns about foreign meddling in U.S. elections.

The company said it shut down 470 “inauthentic” accounts as part of an internal investigation into those ads.

Facebook and rival Google, owned by Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), dominate the fast-growing market for online advertising, in part because they let marketers target their ads based on huge volumes of data.

Facebook reported $27.6 billion in 2016 revenue, the vast majority from advertising.

Ad campaigns that used the anti-Semitic categories on Facebook were not widespread, the company said.

“Given that the number of people in these segments was incredibly low, an extremely small number of people were targeted in these campaigns,” Facebook said.

One change Facebook said it was considering was adding more thorough reviews of targeting categories before they show up in the self-service platform.', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-advertising/facebook-removes-feature-that-let-ads-reach-jew-haters-idUSKCN1BP365') RETURNING "login_stories"."id"; args=("Facebook removes feature that let ads reach 'Jew haters'", 51, datetime.datetime(2017, 9, 15, 6, 25, 31, tzinfo=tzutc()), 'SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) said on Thursday it was temporarily disabling the ability of advertisers to target based on people’s self-reported education and job information after a report that those features allowed targeting based on anti-Semitic topics.\n\nA man poses with a magnifier in front of a Facebook logo on display in this illustration taken in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, December 16, 2015.

Karina Gould, Canada’s minister of democratic institutions, will speak at a launch event next week, Facebook said Thursday in a statement announcing the project.

A company spokeswoman declined to discuss details of the project, which follows a warning by Canada’s electronic spy agency in June that hackers will “very likely” try to influence Canada’s 2019 elections. The agency said it is advising all political parties on how to guard against cyber threats.

Facebook, the world’s largest social network, said last week that an operation likely based in Russia had placed thousands of U.S. ads with polarizing views on topics such as immigration, race and gay rights on the site during a two-year period through May 2017.

The company on Wednesday introduced tougher rules on who can make money from advertising on its network, responding to criticism that it was too easy to profit from fake news and sensational headlines.

Facebook is launching the program in Canada as internet companies seek to fend off criticism they are not doing enough to thwart online interference with elections and politics.

“The spread of misinformation online can sway votes,” said Anatoliy Gruzd, an academic studying social media and politics at Ryerson University, who is slated to speak at the Facebook launch.

“Platforms like Facebook and Twitter really need to put technical measures in place that would prevent the spread of fake information or the creation of groups that may promote hate speech,” Gruzd said.

Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) was expected to brief U.S. congressional investigators soon on whether Russia used its advertising platform to promote divisive social and political messages, a U.S. senator said last week.

Expert Analysts and Data Science Combine to Identify and Rank 18 Technologies with Greatest Potential to Transform the World Over the Next Decade

BOSTON, MA – January 30, 2018 – Business leaders need to be able to spot emerging technologies that present big growth opportunities or serious competitive threats, but are often stuck relying on either subjective opinions or an excess of raw data without context or insight. To help bring the future into better focus, Lux Research, a leading provider of research and advisory services about technology innovation, used a combination of its expert analysts and proprietary data analysis platform to answer the question "What technologies have the greatest potential to transform the world over the next decade?"

“We looked at traditional industry approaches to predicting technology innovations to watch, and they were all based on intuition, surveys of industry executives, news sources, or other lagging indicators - we knew there had to be a better way. We are leading the digital transformation of our own industry with our intelligence platform, designed to surface true leading indicators and equip our analysts with the proprietary data and analytic tools to help our members make better decisions, faster,” said Andrew Stockwell, new Senior VP of Research, Product & Operations at Lux.

From machine learning to synthetic biology and from solid-state batteries to the microbiome, Lux Research''s "18 for 2018" report identifies and ranks 18 technologies that are on track to reshape the world. The rankings are based on the Lux Tech Signal innovation interest score, providing an objective and consistent measure of how much innovation is happening in a given technology or product area, combined with expert insight from their team of science and engineering trained analysts.

The Top 5 Transformative Technologies to Watch in 2018

1) Machine Learning and Deep Neural Networks - Watch for the impact from a 30% annual increase in machine learning patents

2) 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing - Lux expects 3D printing to be a $20 billion market by 2025

3) Genome Editing - $1.2 billion in VC funding will impact industries from food to healthcare

4) 5G Networks - Over 70,000 patents set the stage for 5G network launches in 2018

5) Microbiome - Harnesses the power of personalized microbes for health and nutrition

In addition to describing and ranking the technologies, the report includes key details such as industries that will be affected, key players in each space, and Lux''s take on the potential impact of each technology. Different technologies require different approaches, so the report also groups the technologies into three categories:

The current rock stars of innovation: These include 3D printing (ranked # 2 on the list), 5G networks (#4) and smartwatches (#9). According to Mike Holman, VP Intelligence at Lux Research, "these technologies have been rising stratospherically during the past few years and demonstrate substance. A strategy for each of these technologies is a must-have for any company in relevant industries – but beware of strong competition and the risk of inflated expectations."

Hard problems that remain relevant: Here the analysts point to synthetic biology (#7), energy distribution system monitoring (#14) and sugar substitutes/reduction (#16) and add that "these technologies continue to attract attention due to their massive potential impact, but have had a tough road to commercial impact so far." Lux suggests companies maintain a portfolio approach, rather than make big bets, to manage risk.

Hidden gems: This category includes solid-state batteries (#6), materials informatics (#11) and edge computing (#13). Described as "a bit more under the radar, these technologies do not yet attract much innovation attention in absolute terms, but they are at the beginning of what could be a meteoric rise." The Lux take is that companies should consider starting a program now in order to stake out an early leadership position that could pay off big.

Record Center is your turnkey solution for enterprise-class record management. An extension of Microsoft SharePoint, Record Center arms your users and record managers with a feature-packed, intuitive solution to manage the entire life-cycle of your records. Configure, approve and search for records faster and easier than ever with Record Center.

“Record Center helps our customers wrap their arms around their organization’s complex record management practices” said Product Manager, Michael Greene. “Our goal has always been to find new ways to simplify the process for users and record managers, without compromising compliance or record integrity.”

What’s New in Record Center Version 2?

Enhanced In-Line Preview - The power and convenience of Record Center’s In-Line Document Preview is now available throughout the entire record life-cycle—including the initial upload process—streamlining the entry, review, and validation of metadata on all your records.

New “Browse Records” Functionality - The traditional browse records feature has been modernized to match the look, feel, and behavior of the search-based record retrieval mechanisms. This commonality helps to promote user progression through the three search modes—browse records, keyword searching, and advanced metadata searching with Record Finder.

Performance Enhancements – Version 2 of Record Center includes a number of under-the-hood performance boosts to make your Record Center experience faster and more stable than ever before. With processing times up to 50% faster, and the ability to bulk submit, approve or reject more records than ever before, you’ll spend less time waiting, and more time doing.

Brand New Management Interface - Record Center’s centralized configuration screen has been completely overhauled to provide easy access to configuration of record approvals, user experience options, record security, and auditing – intuitive access to everything a Record Manager needs to administer Record Center.

Completely Redesigned Bulk Upload Add-on - Record Center’s Bulk Upload/Import add-on has been completely redesigned from the ground up to be more flexible, and provide automation options for more seamless execution of long running or large jobs. A more robust validation process helps to ensure that metadata loaded during a bulk upload job is accurate, and meets the requirements configured within Record Center.

Remote Document Processing Features - Remote Document Processing can now be configured to automatically provide the third party provider with a full metadata export detailing the fields they are required to provide values for, along with the valid values of each field (where applicable)— greatly reducing the number of data validation errors when the records are later returned to Record Center using Bulk Upload. Additionally, Remote Document Processing’s new “Maintain Record Continuity” option allows the original document uploader and timestamp to be preserved, even when the record is then processed by a third party. When enabled, this feature provides a full compliance chain, indicating who originally submitted the document, when it was sent for remote processing, when it was returned via bulk upload, and when the bulk upload job physically imported it.

Record Finder - One of Record Center’s hallmark features, Record Finder, allows a user to perform a structured search based on a record’s unique metadata. Record Finder can now be configured with new rules for more flexible selection of a Record’s Document type. Additionally, multiple Record Finder web parts may now be added to a single page, allowing for specific Record Finder configurations tailored to a user’s specific job function.

Salt Lake City, UT -- (ReleaseWire) -- 02/23/2017 -- CollabTalk LLC announces the immediate availability of a SharePoint customer survey to measure the state of the Hybrid SharePoint ecosystem, in partnership with the Marriott School of Management at Brigham Young University. This independent research effort is being conducted by a graduate team from BYU and CollabTalk, and is sponsored by Microsoft along with leading solution providers PixelMill and B&R Business Solutions, and other partners. The survey will be open to SharePoint customers through March 22nd, with final research data and analysis made available in mid-April 2017.



The survey can be found at http://hybrid-sp.collabtalk.com/



According to Bill Baer, Senior Technical Product Manager at Microsoft and one of the leading experts on the topic of hybrid SharePoint, "Office 365 makes the journey to the cloud easy with all the features and benefits of Office: instant access to SharePoint, Exchange, and Skype for Business on any device, any platform, with endless scale. However, for many organizations the cloud is a destination that requires a vision and strategy to make the most of it. Hybrid allows you to bring the cloud to your business while you bring your business to the cloud. Whether you are already well into your cloud journey or just getting started, this study will help us understand where you''re at and what we can do to help."



As collaboration moves from on-prem to the cloud, many organizations struggle with moving years of on-prem SharePoint infrastructure, customizations, and data. There is no accurate data as to how many customers are actively pursuing hybrid solutions as a strategy, versus simply displacing their on-prem environments. Additionally, there is no accurate data identifying and quantifying the gaps between existing on-prem deployments and SharePoint Online, and how many companies are impacted. Having clear data on these gaps will help organizations better understand adoption and engagement issues, and plan future SharePoint strategies.



"Many of our existing and potential clients are excited, but skeptical with making a switch from their tired-yet-trusted on-premises infrastructure straight to the cloud," states Eric Overfield, SharePoint MVP and president of PixelMill, based in Davis, CA. "A hybrid solution sounds promising but the lack of sound data hinders business decisions. This research may help us further understand how organizations are moving to the cloud, which in turn allows us to better collaborate and advise organizations on the best solution for their specific requirements."



"We expect the survey results will help us to better understand where some organizations are experiencing challenges while others are successfully leveraging hybrid deployments," says Mike Oryszak, managing director at B&R Business Solutions, located in Durham, NC. "Results will be used to help our team focus on building the right accelerators to make deployments easier. I also expect that survey feedback will generate a healthy discussion within the technical community on overcoming the obstacles to achieve a successful deployment."

While having a lot of options can be a nice thing, it can also present a challenge when deciding which one should actually be used for your application.

If you ask yourself these five simple questions, selecting the best CT’s for use in your sub metering application will be easy.

What is the goal of the power monitoring project?

For contractors, understanding the overall goal for the installation of the Power Monitoring equipment is important in the selection of the proper equipment. The overall cost and selection of the meters and CT’s are all predicated upon how you are planning to monitor all of the data. Questions like "do I have a building management system?" "Is this a permanent install or temporary install?" "Do I want to use a Power Meter with Data Logging capabilities to download the data into a .CSV type file for use in a spread sheet?" "Am I going to be using the information for Tenant Sub-Metering or billing application?" "Will I be monitoring a single load or multiple loads?"

What is the amperage that I will be monitoring?

Each CT has a useful operating current range, therefore understanding the minimum and maximum operating current for each of the loads to be monitored should be used to properly select the best CT for your application. You can safely use a CT up to the maximum useful operating current as long as it does not exceed that limit. Keep in mind that the minimum useful operating current range is important since this is the point at which the CT will not be able to monitor the current anymore, thus causing the Power Meter to “Snap to Zero”. This means the Power Meter will output that “0” current is being used, even if there is a small amount of current flowing. So in applications where the maximum operating current is below 600 Amps, a standard split/solid-core style CT is recommended due to the increased resolution of the CT, smaller size, and overall cost savings. Why use a RocoilTM CT with a 5 to 5000 Amp useful operating current range to monitor an electrical panel rated for 100 or 200 Amps? The smaller, solid and split core CT’s have a useful operating current range of 1 to 200 Amps (100A Midi CT) or 1 to 300 Amps (200A Midi CT) respectively. Note that RocoilsTM should be used when the wire size or buss bar is too large for the use of the standard solid core or split core CT’s aperture or window as well as in applications with multiple conductors and panels rated above 600 Amps.

How accurate do my CT’s need to be?

For contractors, ease of installation, stocking a single CT, and shorter install times can often lead to the choice of using RocoilsTM over the smaller split/solid-core CT’s. Determining whether or not to use a standard accuracy CT or a Revenue Grade CT has both accuracy and cost implications. The Revenue Grade CT’s have been designed and tested to meet a higher accuracy when used with a Revenue Grade Power Meter and should be used with projects like tenant billing where accuracy is of great importance. Other than the CT''s accuracy, the other main difference is the additional cost of the Revenue Grade CT’s versus that of the Standard Grade CT’s. In a vast majority of applications, using a Standard CT will meet all performance requirements. As discussed above, the key in selecting the proper CT should be based upon the minimum and maximum load size, selecting the CT that will give you the highest amount of sensor resolution. Using a 100 Amp CT on a 100 Amp Load will give you a better sensor resolution when compared to a CT that is rated to 5000 Amps. Each CT type has a place, and knowing when and how to properly select and install them will aid in the overall performance and accuracy of the data.

How much space do I have for the CT’s?

Let’s be honest, there’s not much space in a typical electrical panel. By the time you get everything you need in there, an inch of free-space becomes valuable commodity. In some cases, the mindset that “one CT fits every application” will lead contractors to select RocoilsTM and their larger sizes often takes much needed space. A helpful tip is to make sure that your CT matches the size of the circuit breaker or load being monitored.

Can my CT leads be extended?

Yes, all of the Standard CT’s and RocoilsTM may have their leads extended from the typical six to eight foot length up to a maximum of 100 feet. Typically you can do this in the field or you can custom order it with the proper lead length from the factory. For the best results, ACI recommends to order them with the proper lead length from the factory where there will be no external splices (which can take 3-4 weeks time). If you want to do this in the field, it is imperative to use the same wire type specified by the manufacturer, as well using the Sure-Connect sealed butt splices as recommended by the manufacturer to ensure that they are properly sealed. If you ever have any questions regarding lead length or extension, make sure to sure to contact an HVAC professional.

Knowing the answers to these five questions will not only help you select the proper CT for your application as well as to enable you to greatly reduce the overall cost of the power monitoring system.

These new buildings (and even existing buildings now) strive to meet proper design requirements for things like increased energy efficiencies and occupant comfort. Ventilation standards (such as the ANSI/ASHRAE 62.1-2007) in these buildings help specify minimum rates and other measures intended to provide acceptable levels of indoor air quality (IAQ) to human occupants and minimize adverse health effects.

While still ensuring the standards are met, contractors implement Demand Control Ventilation (DCV) systems. These systems automatically adjust ventilation equipment to control the exchange of additional or outdoor air into an enclosed space through the use of air conditioning equipment. Carbon dioxide sensors located within these spaces continually measure gas levels for actual occupants in the room, versus an assumed fixed rate. By monitoring the levels of CO2 based on the number of people in the space, DCVs help occupants from becoming dizzy, fatigued, or nauseous, while also lowering energy costs by not constantly having to run your system.

ASHRAE 62.1-2007 states that the differential between the indoor and outdoor CO2 levels should be 700 PPM, helping to meet the 15 CFM air flow rates per person. These levels are set to reduce energy costs and unnecessary air treatments, so a CO2 sensor with a good range of PPM measurement is key in maintaining that standard.

Another key component for a good CO2 sensor is the ability to self-calibrate its own sensor.

This ensures an accurate sensor without having to physically re-calibrate all of the time.

But today, 3D printing has reshaped what it means to bring a digital creation to reality. Many industries have felt the impact and influence of the 3D printer, but none more so than the manufacturing industry.

3D printers (a.k.a. additive manufacturing) take the digital design of an object and build it layer by layer. It can make simple things (like a pencil cup holder) or very complex things (like a car) by simply clicking “print”. This technology challenges the idea of industry, bringing manufacturing capabilities from giant companies in a few centralized locations to smaller companies who can print right in their own offices.

Keeping up with the latest technology and incorporating it into your engineering solutions helps companies stay ahead of their competition. Here are four ways a small to midsize manufacturing company will benefit by using a 3D printer.

If You Dream It…

Digital design programs represent a blank canvas for an engineer, giving them endless possibilities to make whatever they can imagine. But limitations (such as physical, practical, and cost) can reign in those endless possibilities. 3D printers enable designers to create brand-new objects, with entirely new and unique properties. They also now have the capacity to print in multi materials and colors, getting you even closer to your desired end result. The ability to create new prototypes, models, and products helps designers collaborate and perform their jobs better, driving down costs and functionality up.

It’s the Little Things in Life

Not every company can afford to own and operate a CNC machine, so their production efforts need to be streamlined as much as possible. A lot of little fixtures can help workers perform their jobs better, but with all things, parts get worn out and broken over time. This is where a 3D printer can really come in handy. The ability to customize a fixture to fit an individual part or production capabilities is huge! Working with folks directly on the production floor to generate a fixture that can satisfy all of their working needs (safety, ease of use, efficiency, etc..) keeps things running as smoothly as possible. Being able to make these custom fixtures in house will save you both time and money!

Money in the Bank

Businesses need to evolve to stay ahead of their competition, which means continually coming up with new products for your customers. The amount of money needed to develop and shape a new product can be a lot for a company, but 3D printers can create working prototypes to determine look and functionality before putting it into mass production. Even after the prototype gets the green light, a 3D printer can even produce the molded part as well. You could go from a sketch on a cocktail napkin to a molded part within 48 hours! Although it’s not recommended for production purposes, a 3D printed mold is capable of roughly 100 shots. So while you won’t be able to print money, a 3D printer will definitely help you save it as you create your new product.

Going Green

Designers know that nobody ever gets something right the first time around. Designing a product can create a lot of waste as you determine the specifics of your design, but with a 3D printer, printing is clean, precise, and will eliminate extensive amounts of product waste. And the closer you are to getting it right the first time, the faster you’ll be able to get your product into production!

Utilizing this and other technologies moving forward will ensure that companies stay competitive, have positive growth, and give their customers the best possible product for its value.', 'http://www.workaci.com/content/how-can-3d-printer-change-your-manufacturing-company') RETURNING "login_stories"."id"; args=('How Can A 3D Printer Change Your Manufacturing Company?', 17, datetime.datetime(2018, 4, 2, 3, 55, 55, 295428), 'Printing used to mean clicking “Ctrl + P” and watching a flat piece of paper come out of a printer.

A whole new world is waiting for you ahead.

Being a mother is a full-time job in itself.

But before that, you have a 9-month long pregnancy to manage.

Pregnancy comes with lots of ups and downs both mentally and physically.

And, if you are working, then managing it the proper way is very important and crucial, as it’s the question of your health and the baby too.

Although maternity leave is available, you still have a lot of time till you reach that point.

It’s definitely not easy, but neither is it as hard as it feels.

Here are a few tips that you can follow to make your pregnancy journey smooth while you continue to work.

Managing your work during pregnancy

Spread the news

Spreading the news doesn’t mean letting everyone in your workplace know it, but your boss and your teammates or immediate colleagues need to know this.

It is generally recommended not to tell anyone until the first trimester is over.

But when you are ready to let people know about the new change in your life, it should be your boss first.

You have to build confidence in him that although there is something new happening in your life, it will not change your productivity or efficiency.

You are still dedicated towards your work.

Your pregnancy is a part of you and not a burden on you.

Get your colleagues and teammates also with confidence, so that when required, they can also be available for your help and cooperate with you well throughout your journey.

Be honest with your Staff Members

Let them know how you’re feeling and what’s going on.

If you feel low or exhausted, then let them know it.

You might feel very bad in the morning hours due to the morning sickness.

Although the second trimester is not so easy as well, the third trimester is usually the hardest as you cannot move around in the office or bend down with the big body.

During this time of your pregnancy, talk to your co-workers and take their help.

Remember not every day is the same. So, don’t forget to take their favor when you are in need.

Get yourself prepared for both good days and worse days.

Rest

In the process of trying to be productive, don’t look over your health.

Take proper rest and eat at regular intervals.

Don’t take any kind of stress and try to be relaxed.

Regular breaks are to be taken at regular intervals.

If your work requires you to sit at your desk for long, then take a break and move around for a small walk at regular intervals. This will avoid numbness in your feet.

And, if you have to move around a lot in your work, then try to avoid standing for a long time and take proper and ample breaks and rest.

Set your priorities

Check what the priority is for the day.

Don’t try to do all the work in a single day.

Work only as much as it supports your health and comfort.

Too much stress or exertion is not good for you and the baby.

If someday, your health doesn’t allow you to work, then check for work from home options too, so that you can work as well as relax fully.

Having Snacks

Morning sickness is the worst thing!!

But, it doesn’t trouble you only during mornings or just in the first trimester (although they are supposed to be off after the first trimester).

It can usually happen at any time of the day or any time of the month and in any trimester.

They can be tackled by having a small number of healthy snacks at regular intervals.

Crackers, fruits or any easy to go snacks should always be available at your desk.

These snacks not only help to fight the morning sickness, but also relieves the small hunger attacks that are very much normal during pregnancy, and make you feel low.

It helps in boosting your energy levels.

Fight your stress

When you are at work, you are bound to get stressed at some point or the other, due to any work issue.

Such stress boosters can be tackled easily with regular parental yoga.

It relaxes your body and boosts your body level.

Deep breath, stressing exercise and brisk walk are the other ways to fight stress.

Being Comfortable

Wear clothes that make you feel comfortable. This is very important.

Both clothes and footwear should be soft and comfortable to make you move all day long without any hassle.

Much trendy maternity clothing is available these days; pick those that suit your body type and comfort well.

Fashionable office wears maternity dresses are on display with a lot of retailers recently.

You can even get them online.

Schedule your Appointments

Book your appointments in a well-planned way.

Get them either before or after your work.

And, if you can’t do so, or if your clinic is nearby, then try visiting during lunch breaks.

Make sure about the timings in advance while setting your appointments.

Office appointments or meetings and Dr. appointments should never coincide as you don’t know how much time each would take.

To be on the safer side and always have a record of all the nearby clinics, in case of emergency.

Final thoughts

By following the above simple tips, you can easily tackle your pregnancy and work together.

Remember it’s only you who knows well about your pregnancy, so be wise and decide everything well in advance. Be prepared.

Don’t forget to talk to your boss about your maternity leave.

Considering your current and future situation, decide how you want to set your maternity leave.

Think!!

Talk to your spouse and decide, which maternity or fertility clinic you would like to get linked up for your pregnancy.

There are many well-established fertility clinic in Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai and many parts of India.

Do a thorough research about the hospital, their doctors, their reviews and experiences from other patients and go for wherever you feel comfortable with.

Your comfort level with the doctor and clinics or hospitals matter’s the most to your pregnancy journey easy and worthwhile.

As much as possible, we all try to learn from other people’s mistakes and emulate the attitudes and behaviors of those who have been successful.

Here are some examples of successful online startup companies. Let’s see what we can learn from their experiences:

1. Angelus Direct

Based in Santa Fe Springs, CA, family-owned Angelus Direct has 108-year old roots as Angelus Shoe Polish. After over a century as a traditional brick-and-mortar establishment, the company took a courageous and ambitious leap into the future when the grandson of the founder decided in 2013 to take the business online.

The transition was wrought with growing pains, from starting out with a cumbersome platform to making less-than-professional quality YouTube videos. As an arts and crafts supplier, Angelus Direct has come to benefit from being able to offer tutorials and product demonstrations on social media.

Add to To-Do List: Leverage Social Media

Angelus Direct credits social media as having played a major role in securing sales and bringing in a majority of the visitor traffic to the site. By reaching out to artists on Instagram and YouTube, you too can offer your product or service for them to bring your product to a larger audience.

Social media allows you to develop and curate a gallery of the possibilities your company offers. Moreover, people generally enjoy being involved in an active and growing community, and the more active you are, the better.

2. Doba

Doba is a marketplace populated by hundreds of manufacturers and suppliers, offering retailers the unique advantage of the ability to sell their products without ever having to purchase and stock materials up front or deal with packing or shipping. This is what dropshipping is all about.

Doba has a very simple mission: to help suppliers and retailers sell more of the right products to the right people. They offer retailers access to over 2 million wholesale products, and this number is expected to grow from here on out.

The Word On The Street: Dropshipping Works

Ever since Zappos.com started dropshipping in 1999, this business model has become the standard for online retail giant Amazon and brick-and-mortar mainstay Sears. Drop shipping has also proven down scalable, proving an effective strategy for full-time independent retailers online.

As an up-and-coming e-commerce entrepreneur, you may find drop shipping attractive because you don’t need to manage inventory or worry about having dead money sitting around in storage in the form of unused stock. This allows you to focus on bringing more customers onboard.

Drop shipping offers plenty of advantages, not the least of which includes the power to control your own margins and enormous flexibility not afforded by traditional retail models.

3. Distil Union

Distil Union was founded in 2011, as a collaborative effort of designers whose ambition was to develop and deliver the products they themselves wanted to see at retail stores.

The story sounds familiar: ambitious corporate employees leaving their jobs to do something innovative. However, they didn’t leave everything behind. By maintaining good relationships with suppliers from their corporate days, the dynamic duo at Distil Union has an entire global network of vendors to leverage.

Distil Union credits their crowdfunding efforts on Kickstarter as an effective springboard for their projects. The platform allows users to find early adopters, design enthusiasts, and potential clients. After launching products on Kickstarter, the company moves on to list their products on Shopify available as preorders.

Take-Home Message: Trying New Things Won’t Hurt.

When you’re just starting out, you’re already trying new things, like it or not. This is the time to be innovative and flexible, learn new skills and take calculated risks. When you have a strong e-commerce community backing you up, starting from scratch isn’t nearly as intimidating as it has to be.

Take Distil Union’s approach to their business, they design new and innovative products, learn new platforms and tools to build their online business and streamline the process, and take part in brand new communities. It hasn’t hurt them so far, and this should be encouraging news for anyone looking to think outside the box.

4. Well+Good

The health and beauty industry, not to mention its online presence and impact, at one point represented a very small percentage of e-commerce. Anyone who had the courage and foresight to be the first to enter this market ten years ago would be considered a genius by now.

Well+Good founders Alexa Brue and Melisse Gelula did just that a decade ago, by launching their media platform focusing on health, beauty, wellness, exercise, and nutrition. They’ve since branched out to cover travel, lifestyle and other topics for their 5 million visitors.

Currently, the company generates annual revenues upwards of eight figures and maintains a staff of over 40 employees.

Something To Prioritize: Having A Strong Company Culture

Well+Good realized an important lesson: it’s what’s on the inside that counts. Outwardly, they are a company that delivers quality content with consistency, and their large readership speaks for itself. On the inside, they have a staff that rallies to their cause. They have consistent ideas and are united in the core values of the company. The founders of Well+Good are not just managers, they’re true leaders who understand how to develop something for people to believe in.

5. Mister Hound

Mister Hound was born out of the desire to fill a happy medium between the mundane and the flashy. They noticed that pet accessories such as leashes and collars for dogs fell into one of two diametrically opposed categories: generic, plain nylon webbing on one hand, and dazzling sparkly and bejeweled accessories on the other. They were simply looking for something that made sense.

Moral of the Story: Be Consistent

At the beginning of Mister Hound’s journey into e-commerce, maintaining a social media presence was inconsistent at best. The founders would vacillate between posting sporadically and having bursts of activity. It’s not always easy to come up with content for your visitors to consume, but making a schedule is a great way to start. The next step would be to stay on course and follow the plan as disciplined as possible.

The strategies we’ve discussed above cover plenty of ideas, from being resourceful to having a combination of courage work ethic and discipline. These principles have been proven to lead to success, regardless of the industry.

Well+Good\n\nThe health and beauty industry, not to mention its online presence and impact, at one point represented a very small percentage of e-commerce. Anyone who had the courage and foresight to be the first to enter this market ten years ago would be considered a genius by now.\n\nWell+Good founders Alexa Brue and Melisse Gelula did just that a decade ago, by launching their media platform focusing on health, beauty, wellness, exercise, and nutrition. They’ve since branched out to cover travel, lifestyle and other topics for their 5 million visitors.\n\nCurrently, the company generates annual revenues upwards of eight figures and maintains a staff of over 40 employees.\n\nSomething To Prioritize: Having A Strong Company Culture\n\nWell+Good realized an important lesson: it’s what’s on the inside that counts. Outwardly, they are a company that delivers quality content with consistency, and their large readership speaks for itself. On the inside, they have a staff that rallies to their cause. They have consistent ideas and are united in the core values of the company. The founders of Well+Good are not just managers, they’re true leaders who understand how to develop something for people to believe in.\n\nWebsite: https://www.wellandgood.com/\n\n5. Mister Hound\n\nMister Hound was born out of the desire to fill a happy medium between the mundane and the flashy. They noticed that pet accessories such as leashes and collars for dogs fell into one of two diametrically opposed categories: generic, plain nylon webbing on one hand, and dazzling sparkly and bejeweled accessories on the other. They were simply looking for something that made sense.\n\nMoral of the Story: Be Consistent\n\nAt the beginning of Mister Hound’s journey into e-commerce, maintaining a social media presence was inconsistent at best. The founders would vacillate between posting sporadically and having bursts of activity. It’s not always easy to come up with content for your visitors to consume, but making a schedule is a great way to start. The next step would be to stay on course and follow the plan as disciplined as possible.\n\nWebsite: https://www.misterhound.com/\n\nThe strategies we’ve discussed above cover plenty of ideas, from being resourceful to having a combination of courage work ethic and discipline. These principles have been proven to lead to success, regardless of the industry.\n\nWhat other tactics have you learned to be successful in your entrepreneurial endeavors?

Things I learned about myself:

1. I loved New York only from the outside. Once I started breathing inside Manhattan, I found it too fast for my lifestyle.

2. I was absolutely not cut out for the Financial Industry. Here were these crazy (skilled) ivy league kids who were Factotum. They lived and breathed minting money.

3. I couldn’t see myself walking around and living (yes, spending 14–16 hours) inside the huge, ‘spoiling you rotten’ corporate building in my heels all my life.

4. I was very unconventional in my choices since I was a kid. New York was almost everyone’s dream place in my immediate peer group.

5. I wanted to work for MYSELF. Later, I will learn there is no concept of working for yourself. You are always listening to your clients, co-founders, family, friends, investors etc. Basically working for them too.

My dad is a small, run of the mill, businessman and he lived a far more relaxed, happier (without SOHO and the dream job in New York) and fulfilling life back in India.

6. I have to utterly love what I do or else just like every forth (don’t have the correct stats) millennial, I will quit multiple jobs hence contributing to our overall reputation.

From Sigmund Freud to Carl Jung, the growing understanding of psychology had finally refined to an extent that it has clearly revealed to the world that a major part of our personalities as an adult is formed during our childhood. Thus, the study of child psychology has become increasingly noticeable and important for the world and on domestic levels, to parents.

Children books like Alice in Wonderland now have become important books of research for not only literary critics and historians but also psychologists and philosophers. What''s even more interesting is that the closer studies have raveled that Lewis Carroll was somehow able to understand child psychology before the discovery and development of the subject by Freud. Carroll''s children books and the story of his own life remain an interesting topic of debate and discussion.

The point of incepting this article with such a complicated subject is to make you aware of how severe and utterly important is this subject, i.e., significance of bond between a parent and a child and how sometimes our parents, obliviously, becomes the reason behind our timid selves, fear and distress- often leading child to depression, heartbreak or hopelessness. This happens because, as a little, innocent, undeveloped mind, the behavior, personality, words, and actions of a parent, effects the mentality and brain of the child directly. The child takes in whatever objects and subjects he or she might see, hear or touch.

As a child, we often tend to hear various things from our parents which affect our thinking and actions deeply. These statements might come directly from their traditions, social structures or extreme fears. And all these statements are little-bit different for a girl and a boy.





If you are a boy, crying about something you feel bad about, you are told to be a man and ultimately, hide your emotions. This makes you less sensitive towards people and circumstances. And if you are above fourteen or an adult, and have heard these words, then you can compare, how at times, you feel covering your heart and feelings, often doing so deliberately; left alone to deal with your problems and anxieties. If you are a girl, you are told to sit, stand, walk and eat in a "ladylike" way- ways that cage you inside the patriarchal social structure. If you are a grown-up girl of sixteen or now a "lady", you might know how it is like to live in a lie or handling two different personalities- one that only you know any other that you have to carry as your parents told and now as your society tells you so.

At times, parents often forget that one day their children have to face the realities of the cruel world and he/she is a separate, independent individual who has right to put his/her opinion or live in a certain way, as they want.

Parents, who have a single child or after a long pining has been able to get one or are just too sensitive/caring because of their own past or understanding—ends up over-protecting and shielding their child. They often hide the problems they are facing financially or otherwise. At times, they tend to stop the child to go out in a park alone, or play games in afternoon under the heating sun, for they fear that the child will get lost or kidnapped or will fall ill. Such fears and perceptions only hike the worry. Often a child starts to think of such negative possibilities all the time.

Instead of making them aware of the reality, they just tend to say "No!" And "Stop!". This happens often in middle-class families. Such parents don''t recognize that such sort of hiding, makes the child feel less important in a family, dominated, controlled, weak, confused and often alone. The urge to get out of this and curiosity, at times leads a child to step in wrong directions. This makes the child- timid, weak and extremely sensitive emotionally as well physically.

Certain parents fulfill all sorts of demands, right or wrong, of their children. Such parents just wish to give their children all the comforts of life. But they forget that this often leads kids to careless, stubborn and weak selves.

Excessive pampering, protection or control, only leads to insensitivity, rebel or distress. Hiding is never the way. Parents can never hide their child from the difficulties forever. Though the morals are tried to be taught to them by their teachers and parents or any other adults, the practical situations are tougher than theory in the lab of life and the world.

As a little kid or baby, you were like brick clay, and when "excavated", you realize that the only difference between you and that brick clay was that you were born pure and the brick clay is impure at first. Slowly you start observing and grasping the people, objects, and formations around you, which just float inside your head. As a small kid, you believed and did as your parents told you. You knew that for every other small need or problem, you have to go to your mother/father and it will be alright.





Like, the soil is blended in other material for the preparation of a good brick; steadily, as a teenager, when your brain starts to develop and you start making your own opinions on things, you see yourself facing the highs and lows constantly which happens through your interaction with more "material",i.e., people, thoughts and objects, when you are not surrounded by your parents. You experience times, when you feel, "broken up", "watered" with encouragement or sadness, "kneaded" somehow-either negatively or positively. The part which your parents don''t able to foresee at times is this!

Too much of protection will mold the "brick" in a certain form, which might end up making him/her- childish, careless, immature, confused, hopeless, irresponsible, distressed, or alone. Often in case of molding a child a certain way, parents end up with adverse results.

But whatever a parent do to up-bring their child, is part of their own past, understanding and often the way they were grown up by their own parents. What any youth, parent or teenager might comprehend is that one of the most significant parts of brick making is burning of the brick!

It takes about 24 hours to heat up the brick in kilns after "loading" them. They are burnt at the temperature around 1000 to 1200 Degree Celsius and then it requires around 12 days of cooling down of bricks after "unloading" them.

No matter what, one day every child has to become an adult. A parent must face this truth and at times should allow their child to see the reality, so as to prepare their children for tougher situations in future. Let them take the "load" and feel the "heat", alongside, keep an eye on their progress. Fuel them with necessary lessons of life. From compassion to passion, instill in them these words slowly, so as to make them ready for the fun and adventure of life; preparing them to face any situation by making their attitude towards life- positive. They must learn to cool down, after every high or low, which will only add more beauty to their formation, i.e., the journey of life. It will only add in more experience.

This is the reason why, the kids of poor backgrounds are much clever and successful than kids of settled, richer or better families. The big families with no economic safeties, are prone to stormy days, and cannot really protect their kids from the dirt of the world. These kids heat up more on daily basis, from a very tender age and often, their strength and good morals-taught to them by their parents- lead them to better lives. Parents of such kids can either have a completely negative outlook towards life or a positive one. Those who have a positive one, bind all the hopes from their kids at times, instilling in them essential teachings of life and thus making them stronger. A sense of responsibility is on their shoulders from the beginning of their lives.

There are endless examples of it if we look around. Namely- APJ Abdul Kalam, Michael Jackson, Anupam Kher, Kapil Sharma, Narender Modi etc. These famous personalities tell us the importance of burning in the "high heat" like a brick and "Not a soft one for early and easy split". Their extreme struggles made them "greats" or even "legendary".

Everyone dreams of having their own business. Some of us inherit from our forefathers; some slog it out and build their empire!

There is a new breed of enterprising youth who are ''forced'' to consider starting on your own due to various levels of dissatisfaction at work.



In this post, I am not writing lengthy stories or some advice on Entrepreneurship, rather I would prefer to make deliver my perspective in bullet points to highlight the pros and cons:

Why should you quit your regular job and start your own enterprise:

- If you are looking to build a steady stream of passive income initially and gradually over a period of five to six years relying on that source of income by offering products/services in your niche area.



- When you realize that you have gained sufficient experience in your core competency, and you want to start your own consultancy offering similar or even advanced services/products in your area of work.

- When you feel that you have a basic saleable idea which can be turned into a revolutionary product or service, to serve an existing need in the market. E.g. This is how most startups are born, out of a need which in turn, drives an entrepreneur to build an app around it.

Why you should NOT quit your regular job:

- If you are a subject matter expert or specialist working on new technology or any particular area of work that identifies with your niche offerings, then you are better off continuing and looking for further growth in your job.

- When you have an opportunity to work on multiple projects and your company offers you vertical as well as horizontal growth, then it is better to explore your career options within that company/group.



- Every professional goes through a moment of crisis in work/life balance. So, just in case, you are working with flexible timings that allow you enough free time and space to accommodate other tasks or engage in your holistic growth process.

Why I quit my steady corporate job with a multinational company in 2010:



The moment it struck me that ''training'' and ''consultancy'' is something which drives me to deliver performance to my clients, I just jumped onto it with three months of advance salary back up.Initially, there is a lot of resistance from all corners and it takes at least three years to build a sustainable revenue stream from your clients. But, the answer to all these issues is two words: If you have heard your calling, then passion will drive you, and persistence will sail you through tough times. ---- Prof. Sameer Anil Karna

Entrepreneurs are mostly born, and only few can be cultivated. There is an inherent calling within you that drives professionals to turn entrepreneurs. I had figured out that calling a long time back.

So, just in case, you are working with flexible timings that allow you enough free time and space to accommodate other tasks or engage in your holistic growth process.\n\nWhy I quit my steady corporate job with a multinational company in 2010:\n\n\n\nThe moment it struck me that 'training' and 'consultancy' is something which drives me to deliver performance to my clients, I just jumped onto it with three months of advance salary back up.Initially, there is a lot of resistance from all corners and it takes at least three years to build a sustainable revenue stream from your clients. But, the answer to all these issues is two words: If you have heard your calling, then passion will drive you, and persistence will sail you through tough times. ---- Prof. Sameer Anil Karna\n\nEntrepreneurs are mostly born, and only few can be cultivated. There is an inherent calling within you that drives professionals to turn entrepreneurs. I had figured out that calling a long time back.\n\n", 'https://yourstory.com/mystory/70daa7ec0f-why-i-quit-my-9-to-5-j')

This Saturday morning I woke up at 9:30 am, with the uncomfortable feeling of a cold and a little tiredness. I decide to get up for good because I have to wake up my children to go to their sports lesson. It is usually my wife who takes care of this but she left earlier this morning to attend a conference and will be back at 5 pm. Today it''s been 7 years that I''m with her, I have to buy her a huge bouquet of roses.

Surprise. When I walk through the door, a violent feeling of cold grips me, nothing more horrible knowing that I''m already cold, a little rain mixed with a few snowflakes are falling from the sky. It''s decided, today I do not go out.

First, I have to call an Uber to bring the kids to their tennis and dance lessons, it''s a few miles after all this should not cost me more than £10 round trip. The first problem solved. But this is only the beginning.

This feeling of cold isn’t budging. Call me dramatic, but I need a diagnosis from the doctor. I really do not want to take public transport in this state. A friend had told me about an application called Babylon that lets you call a doctor on FaceTime. I don’t hesitate for a second and download the app.

At the time of downloading, problem! The screen of my iPhone which was already cracked does not work anymore. So I decided to make the appointment using my computer. First good news of the day, I can see a doctor in under 10 minutes.

But no time to savor. I have several important calls in the afternoon and I can not use my mobile phone anymore. I''m starting to realize that I will probably have to go out to find an iPhone repair shop. But I’m smarter than that. I type "Repair iPhone London" to see customer reviews. Luck! I come across a website called Repairly which is able to pick up my phone in less than 30 minutes, fix it and bring it back to me in less than 3 hours! AMAZING. This means that I will have my phone back at 2 pm maximum.

A problem never happens alone. I decide to go prepare food for lunch because the children will arrive in 1 hour. Unfortunately for me when I turn on the tap, I realize that there is a leak in the sink. Me who thought to spend a quiet day at home ... I must now repair a small leak and I do not want it at all. But no choice, I go to the garage to look for tools, but again I do not have the ones I need.

I have two choices: call a plumber, but it may cost me quite a lot and I know that the end of the month will be quite difficult, or buy my wrench, my screws and my hammer on Amazon Same-Day to fix it myself. I will opt for the second solution, it will be more economical, and in addition, I will be delivered in just two hours.

All this did not solve the problem of what we will eat for lunch. Again, 2 solutions are available to me: go out and go buy a McDonalds, or continue on my way and order good food on Deliveroo. Again, I chose the second solution. It will surely come back to me a little more expensive, but hey time is money, right? I order a good pizza from Pizza Pilgrims.

The order will arrive in 25 minutes. Perfect timing. It’s now 12:15 pm the children have arrived and I think they will be delighted to eat good pizzas. I have not told them yet, I surprise them. I ask them to set the table by the delivery man will arrive in a short time. It is now 12:40, the delivery man is in front of the door. I am impressed by the precision of the app.

After the meal, I get a Repair notification that tells me that my phone is repaired and that a deliveryman is on my way to bring it back to me. Perfect. 10 minutes later, I receive a notification from Amazon Same-Day telling me that my tools will be delivered in 15 minutes. At this point, I feel like the on-demand king. A true millennial. I and my smartphone can do anything.

Someone is ringing the door! It is the delivery man from repairly who brings me back my iPhone, I see that it is well repaired and it’s in a nice case.

I now go to the Bloom & Wild website and order 30 roses because we are both 30 years old. The flowers will be delivered before the return of my wife. At the end of my order, someone else rings the doorbell. This is the delivery man of Amazon who brings me my tools.

I almost forgot about tonight''s meal. It must be exceptional, I want to impress my wife. A friend told me about a company named Home Run that delivers home groceries at a moments notice. I go to their website, place my order to prepare a meal 2.0. Smoked salmon, potato, green vegetables, I think she will be thrilled. Most importantly, she’ll have no idea that I’ve not left the house all day. My groceries will be delivered within the hour.

It is 4 pm, I have to give another gift to my wife. Call it laziness guilt. I read in the newspaper about an app called LeSalon that provides home beauty services: manicure, pedicure, waxing. I do not hesitate a second, I reserve a ‘Salonista’ for 5.30pm.

Today I really did not want to go out, and I think I did not take the tip of my nose out. But despite that, I was able to make sure that kids get to their sports lessons, consult a doctor, fix my phone, buy tools, eat the best pizza in London, offer 30 roses to my wife and a manicure, and finally do my food shopping.
